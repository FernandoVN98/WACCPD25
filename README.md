# WACCPD25
This GitHub repository containd the Artifact corresponding to the article: "Scalable Neural Network Training: Distributed Data-Parallel Approaches", submitted to the WACCPD 2025 workshop.

This GitHub repository is divided into two different folders: **Classification** and **Regression**. The experiments evaluate the training times and results obtained by the neural networks on two different problems, one is a classification problem and the other regression. Each folder contains the corresponding experiments.

## Requirements

In order to reproduce the experiments some requirements should be met.

### Hardware

It is required to have access to a large number of GPUs, some of the experiments require up to 64 GPUs. The GPUs used are Nvidia Hopper with 64 HBM2 memory. However, other GPUs can be used; of course, it can't be expected to obtain the same times using other hardware, maybe a similar time, but different.

### Software



### Data

The dataset used in the Classification experiments is publicly available. It has a [GitHub](https://github.com/BayesWatch/cinic-10), where it is explained how to load it, its distribution, etc and a link to downloaded the dataset is available. It can also be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mengcius/cinic10/data).
