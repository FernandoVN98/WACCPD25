# Classification
Inside this folder one can find the experiments included in the paper: "Scalable Neural Network Training: Distributed Data-Parallel Approaches". 
Inside the **Figures** folder one can find the training curves obtained using different training strategies. The folder **Generate_Dataset** contains the script used to load the CINIC-10 dataset and transform it 
into PyTorch tensors that were used in the experiments. 

There are two more folders: **Training_Losses** and **Times**

## Training Losses
